Abstract
-----------

We propose to introduce a new class, **Implementation**, to represent different
replicates of physical design realizations. In practice, `Implementation` will
mostly identify cell clones or experimental batches of
material. `Implementation` will allow to collate experimental results as they
are recorded for one particular clone or biological replicate. `Implementation`
will serve as the connection point between experimental results with theoretical
design and a, often more detailed, description of the system as it was actually
built.

### 1. Rationale <a name="rationale"></a>
----------------

The SBOL 2.x data model allows the detailed description of a bioengineering design. 


### 2. Specification <a name="specification"></a>
----------------------------------------------

We propose the introduction of a new class `Implementation` which represents one particular physical realization of a design. A given instance of `Implementation` may identify one particular bacterial colony picked from a transformation plate (and all cell culture samples beloning to this clone), or it may identify one particular batch of plasmid DNA derived from one such clone, or one batch of a synthetic protein expressed and purified in one particular lab. 

#### 2.1 class Implementation

The class is derived from sbol:TopLevel giving it the following fields (please verify):
  - displayID
  - name
  - description

In addition, `Implementation` defines the following new fields:

  - `design` [mandatory, 1..1] -- link to a `ComponentDefinition` or a `ModuleDefinition` describing the design to which this replicate is *supposed* to adhere. This does not strictly imply that the replicate or clone *actually* correctly implements the design. `design` gives direct access to the sequence information against which different clones or replicates can be validated.

  - `built` [optional, 0..1] -- optional link to a `ComponentDefinition` or `ModuleDefinition` which describes the actual composition (e.g. in most cases sequence) recorded for this particular replicate. This may deviate from the original design (e.g. an unintended mutation invalidating this clone) or it may add additional detail that falls outside the scope of the design (e.g. the random DNA sequence flanking a genomic insert) and which distinguishes this particular clone from other replicates.
  
  - `implementationStatus` -- one of `planning`, `construction`, `validatedCorrect`, `validatedIncorrect`, `validatedAmbiguous`, `abandonned`
 
#### 2.2 Relation to LIMS and physical samples in the lab

SBOL currently has no concept for physical samples in the lab. `Implementation` is meant to represent clones or batches which, in many cases, will encompass more than one sample. Ultimately, practical use will show where the boundary between different batches is drawn. provO vocabulary can be used to track relationships between clones and batches.

< Describe brief examples or use cases >

### 4. Backwards Compatibility <a name='compatibility'></a>
-----------------

Since this is a new class, no backwards compatibility issues are expected.
