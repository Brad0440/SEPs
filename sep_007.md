----------------------------------------------

I propose introducing a `ComponentDerivation` top-level class. Combinatorial designs would then be described as follows:

 1. Define a ComponentDefinition with the skeleton of your design. Add subcomponents for each of the sub-parts. Add any feature constraints.

 2. Create a ComponentDerivation referring to this `ComponentDefinition` as its target to expand. 
  
 3. Provide an `Alternatives` object inside the `ComponentDerivation`.
 Each one links a single subcomponent from the expansion target to a bag of of `ComponentDefinitions` that are possible replacements.
 The bag can be explicitly enumerated, or can be a reference to a `Collection` of `ComponentDefinition` instances to be used.
  
 4. Generate any number of `ComponentDefinition`s from this by picking single alternatives from the ComponentDerivation.
  
 5. The expanded `ComponentDefinition`s SHOULD use `PROVO` annotations to point to the `ComponentDerivation` instance used, and to capture any parameters.
  
 6. If many expansions were made from a single `ComponentDerivation`, these MAY BE collected together in a `Collection`.
   This collection SHOULD use `PROVO` annotations to point to the `ComponentDerivation` instance used to generate the whole set of designs, and to capture any parmeters.

-------------------------------

## Enumerating expansions of alternatives

Here we will do an all-vs-all combinatorial expansion of a template design.
The result is a more concrete design.

Given an abstract design with four sub-components:

```
gfpReporter : ComponentDefinition
  description = "An abstract GFP reporter"
  sequenceConstraint = glucoseSensitivePromoter precedes rbs1234
  sequenceConstraint = rbs1234 precedes gfp
  sequenceConstraint = gfp precedes terminator1234
```

Specify a library of GFPs:

```
gfpLibrary : Collection
  description = "A library of various GFP CDSes"
  member = gfp1
  member = gfp2
  member = gfp3
```

And we have two glucose-sensitive promoters:

```
gluP_ABC : ComponentDefinition
  description = "Glucose-sensitive promoter"
  type = DNA
  role = Promoter

gluP_XYZ : ComponentDefinition
  description = "Glucose-sensitive promoter"
  type = DNA
  role = Promoter
```

We could define a space of expansions:

```
gfpReporterDerv1 : ComponentDerivation
  descrption = "Derive various more concrete designs from gfpReporter by choosing some alternatives for the promoter and GFP."
  using = gfpReporter 
  strategy = enumerate
  alternative : Alternative
    at = glucoseSensitivePromoter
    oneOf = gluP_ABC
    oneOf = gluP_XYZ
  alternative : Alternative
    at = gfp
    from = gfpLibrary
```

This could then be used to generate a `Collection` of possible expansions, using a direct re-write:

```
gfpReporterExp1 : Collection
  description = "Expansions of gfpReporterDerv1"

  prov:wasGeneratedBy : prov:Activity
    identity = gfpReporterExp1Activity
    prov:used = gfpReporterDerv1
    prov:wasAssociatedWith : prov:SoftwareAgent
      name = "expanderbot 2000"
      version = "0.1.3"
  
  member : ComponentDefinition
    prov:wasGeneratedBy : prov:Activity
      prov:wasInformedBy = gfpReporterExp1Activity
      prov:used:gluP_ABC
      prov:used:gfp1
    type = DNA
    role = Operon
    sequenceConstraint = gluP_ABC precedes rbs1234
    sequenceConstraint = rbs1234 precedes gfp1
    sequenceConstraint = gfp1 precedes terminator1234

  member : ComponentDefinition
    prov:wasGeneratedBy : prov:Activity
      prov:wasInformedBy = gfpReporterExp1Activity
      prov:used:gluP_XYZ
      prov:used:gfp1
    type = DNA
    role = Operon
    sequenceConstraint = gluP_XYZ precedes rbs1234
    sequenceConstraint = rbs1234 precedes gfp1
    sequenceConstraint = gfp1 precedes terminator1234

  member : ComponentDefinition
    prov:wasGeneratedBy : prov:Activity
      prov:wasInformedBy = gfpReporterExp1Activity
      prov:used:gluP_ABC
      prov:used:gfp2
    type = DNA
    role = Operon
    sequenceConstraint = gluP_ABC precedes rbs1234
    sequenceConstraint = rbs1234 precedes gfp2
    sequenceConstraint = gfp2 precedes terminator1234

  member : ComponentDefinition
    prov:wasGeneratedBy : prov:Activity
      prov:wasInformedBy = gfpReporterExp1Activity
      prov:used:gluP_XYZ
      prov:used:gfp2
    type = DNA
    role = Operon
    sequenceConstraint = gluP_XYZ precedes rbs1234
    sequenceConstraint = rbs1234 precedes gfp2
    sequenceConstraint = gfp2 precedes terminator1234

  member : ComponentDefinition
    prov:wasGeneratedBy : prov:Activity
      prov:wasInformedBy = gfpReporterExp1Activity
      prov:used:gluP_ABC
      prov:used:gfp3
    type = DNA
    role = Operon
    sequenceConstraint = gluP_ABC precedes rbs1234
    sequenceConstraint = rbs1234 precedes gfp3
    sequenceConstraint = gfp3 precedes terminator1234

  member : ComponentDefinition
    prov:wasGeneratedBy : prov:Activity
      prov:wasInformedBy = gfpReporterExp1Activity
      prov:used:gluP_XYZ
      prov:used:gfp3
    type = DNA
    role = Operon
    sequenceConstraint = gluP_XYZ precedes rbs1234
    sequenceConstraint = rbs1234 precedes gfp3
    sequenceConstraint = gfp3 precedes terminator1234
```

The `prov` annotations are optional, but ensure that there is a full trace of how these entities were generated.

## Enumerating a `sequenceConstraint` space

This time we will sample a constraints-based design, to explore a space of possible orderings.

Thie `abstractOperon` design places two orfs between a promoter and terminator, but does not constrain the relative ordering of the orfs themselves.

```
abstractOperon : ComponentDefinition
  type = DNA
  role = Operon
  sequenceConstraint = p123 precedes orf1
  sequenceConstraint = p123 precedes orf2
  sequenceConstraint = orf1 precedes t567
  sequenceConstraint = orf2 precedes t567
```

We will derive their orderings.

```
abstractOperonDer1 : ComponentDerivation
  description = "Derive the various unambiguous orderings 
  using = abstractOperon
  strategy = enumerate
```

This will give us (eliding the provenance):

```
abstractOperonExp1 : Collection
  member : ComponentDefinition
    type = DNA
    role = Operon
    sequenceConstraint = p123 precedes orf1
    sequenceConstraint = orf1 precedes orf2
    sequenceConstraint = orf2 precedes t567
  member : ComponentDefinition
    type = DNA
    role = Operon
    sequenceConstraint = p123 precedes orf2
    sequenceConstraint = orf2 precedes orf1
    sequenceConstraint = orf1 precedes t567
```

## Two enumerations

We can have multiple different expansions for the same template design.

```
gfpReporter : ComponentDefinition
  description = "An abstract GFP reporter"
  sequenceConstraint = glucoseSensitivePromoter precedes rbs1234
  sequenceConstraint = rbs1234 precedes gfp
  sequenceConstraint = gfp precedes terminator1234
  
der1 : ComponentDerivation
  using gfpReporter
  strategy = enumerate
  alternative : Alternative
    at = glucoseSensitivePromoter
    oneOf = gluP_ABC
    oneOf = gluP_XYZ
  
der2 : ComponentDerivation
  using gfpReporter
  strategy = enumerate
  alternative : Alternative
    at = gfp
    from = gfpLibrary
```

These two derivations give rise to two independent families of enumerations from the same design (again with provenance elided):

```
exp1 : Collection
  member : ComponentDefinition
    sequenceConstraint = gluP_ABC precedes rbs1234
    sequenceConstraint = rbs1234 precedes gfp
    sequenceConstraint = gfp precedes terminator1234
  member : ComponentDefinition
    sequenceConstraint = gluP_XYZ precedes rbs1234
    sequenceConstraint = rbs1234 precedes gfp
    sequenceConstraint = gfp precedes terminator1234

exp2 : Collection
  member : ComponentDefinition
    sequenceConstraint = glucoseSensitivePromoter precedes rbs1234
    sequenceConstraint = rbs1234 precedes gfp1
    sequenceConstraint = gfp1 precedes terminator1234
  member : ComponentDefinition
    sequenceConstraint = glucoseSensitivePromoter precedes rbs1234
    sequenceConstraint = rbs1234 precedes gfp2
    sequenceConstraint = gfp2 precedes terminator1234
  member : ComponentDefinition
    sequenceConstraint = glucoseSensitivePromoter precedes rbs1234
    sequenceConstraint = rbs1234 precedes gfp3
    sequenceConstraint = gfp3 precedes terminator1234
```

As the derivation logic is external to the `ComponentDefinition`, we could take one of the expanded instances above and use it as the target of another `ComponentDerivation` to further expand it out.

## Probablistic sampling

Starting again with our gfp reporter, we could use the `sample` strategy rather than the `enumerate` one that we've used so far.

```
der1 : ComponentDerivation
  using gfpReporter
  strategy = sample
  alternative : Alternative
    at = glucoseSensitivePromoter
    oneOf = gluP_ABC
    oneOf = gluP_XYZ
  alternative : Alternative
    at = gfp
    from = gfpLibrary
```

We can sample this once to get:

```
sampled1 : ComponentDefinition
  prov:wasGeneratedBy : prov:Activity
    identity = gfpReporterExp1Activity
    prov:used = der1
    prov:wasAssociatedWith : prov:SoftwareAgent
      name = "samplebot G1"
      version = "9.1"
      randomSeed = "9837453"^^xs:long
  sequenceConstraint = gluP_ABC precedes rbs1234
  sequenceConstraint = rbs1234 precedes gfp2
  sequenceConstraint = gfp2 precedes terminator1234
```

# 4. Backwards Compatibility <a name='compatibility'></a>
-----------------

New class, no issues anticipated.

# 5. Discussion <a name='discussion'></a>
-----------------

**Advantages:**

We have a complete log of the expansion options and of the individual expansions. 
You can also use provo annotations to document that a ComponentDefinition was made by expanding
a ComponentDerivation. It also gives you a separation between the abstract design and the strategy 
used to refine it into a concrete design. You could take the same template and expand it with 
several different ComponentDerivation instances with different sets of alternatives, 
or expand out that same template manually.
