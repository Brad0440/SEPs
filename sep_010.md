Abstract
-----------

There are two very different types of 'part annotation'. (1) part composition relationships -- These always point to an existing (and presumably re-usable) sub-component. Sequence location or indeed sequence information may or may not be available. (2) Classic sequence feature annotations -- As known from the genbank format, these only apply to clearly specified sequence regions but often do not point to meaningful sub-parts.

Currently, `Component` alone is sufficient to describe sub-part relations without any sequence information. This however is the exception in synthetic biology practice. Both `SequenceAnnotation` and `Component` are needed for SBOL encoding of actual genetic designs with parts and sub-parts (because `Component` lacks a `location` field). Conversly, the annotation of simple sequence features requires the creation of `SequenceAnnotation`, `Component` and `ComponentDefinition` records, mainly because `SequenceAnnotation` lacks "name" and "description" fields. This overlapping role of `SequenceAnnotation` and `Component` leads to multiple redundancies and unnecessary complexities.

We propose to modify `Component` and `SequenceAnnotation` such that `Component` is solely responsible for the description of part - subpart relationships (with or without sequence) and `SequenceAnnotation` is solely responsible for the description of genbank-style sequence features.


1. Rationale <a name="rationale"></a>
----------------

### 1.1 current situation

The current `SequenceAnnotation` class has a dual purpose:

(1) Its primary role is to specify the location of "sub-parts" within the sequence of a parent ComponentDefinition. To this end, `SequenceAnnotation` links one or more `Location` records with a `Component`. The `Component`, in turn, refers to a `ComponentDefinition` (via its `definition` field). This `ComponentDefinition` is the description of the actual sub-part. Actual physical composition is therefore defined like this:

`ComponentDefinition` -[`sequenceAnnotation`]-> `SequenceAnnotation` -[`component`]-> `ComponentDefinition` -[`definition`]-> `ComponentDefinition`

The directionality (which one is parent and which one is a sub-part) is frequently confused. Moreover, the parent `ComponentDefinition` also directly links to the sub-part `Component` via a `component` field. This is necessary so that composition can be described before any sequences (and thus sequence locations) are known. An additional chain of references is therefore needed, in parallel to the one shown above:

`ComponentDefintion` -[`component`]-> `Component` -[`definition`]-> `ComponentDefinition`

Adding to this redundancy, both `Component` and `SequenceAnnotation` may have `role` properties that diverge from the `role` (functional classification) of the target `ComponentDefinition`. Whether a diverging `role` is attached to `Component` or `SequenceAnnotation` is an arbitrary choice. This invites conflicting implementations and interpretations of this field. 

Evidently, SBOL makes the description of "undefined", "loose bag", part composition without any sequence information relatively easy. By contrast, the description of actual genetic designs with actual sequences is surprisingly complex and redundant. This is unfortunate because the latter is, by and far, the overwhelming use case of SBOL. It also hinders adoption by sequence-level designers and tool developers. 

(2) The secondary role of `SequenceAnnotation` is to simply annotate regions of interest within a given sequence. Arguably, this should be its primary role (hence the name) as it is a very common use case in practice. However, this function is currently only supported in theory, not in practice.

A `SequenceAnnotation` without `component` can be created and linked to a region of, e.g., DNA. However, the only other field available for describing this region is `role` which must point to a SO term. By contrast, Genbank annotations naturally have a 'name' and a 'description' attached to them. `SequenceAnnotation` is lacking these fields because it is (in the sub-part scenario) supposed to link to another ComponentDefinition. Therefore, even the most simple annotation of, let's say, a START codon, requires us to create the full chain of `SequenceAnnotation` -> `Component` -> `ComponentDefinition`. This introduces the additional complication of creating lots of meaningless and potentially overlapping part definitions that are not meant to be actual (re-usable) parts.


### 1.2 Goals of the proposal

(1) Support / simplify classic sequence annotations of features which do not fall into the part - subpart category. As a welcome side effect, this should make it much easier to move back and forth between SBOL and large bodies of existing genbank-formatted information and related software. This will become the sole purpose of the `SequenceAnnotation` class.

(2) Simplify the part-subpart relationship via `Component` so that it does not any longer require `SequenceAnnotation`.

(3) Create a syntactic parallel between sequence/physical and functional part-subpart relations in SBOL -- The `Component` class will be equivalent in syntax and meaning to the existing `Participation` class. For programmers, the pattern `ComponentDefinition -> Component(role) -> ComponentDefinition` will look and feel like the already established pattern `Interaction -> Participation(role) -> ComponentDefinition`. 

(4) Remove ambiguity as to how things can / should be expressed at the sequence layer to aid meaningful data exchange. 


2. Specification <a name="specification"></a>
----------------------------------------------

### 2.1 Add `location` field to `Component`

Add the following *optional* field to `Component`:

  * [0..n] `location` pointing to a `Location` on the *parent* `ComponentDefinition` sequence; if missing, this indicates a part / sub-part relationship for which sequence details have not (yet) been determined.


### 2.2 Modify `SequenceLocation` for sequence feature annotation

Remove the following fields from `SequenceAnnotation`:

  * `component` -- SequenceAnnotation is not any longer used for part - subpart relations
  * `roleIntegration` -- there is no sub-part with which `role` fields may be in conflict
  
Add the following fields to `SequenceAnnotation`:

  * [1] `name` pointing to short literal for human consumption (required)
  * [0..1] `description` pointing to a human-readable comment (optional)

The other fields are retained from the SBOL 2.1 `SequenceAnnotation`

  * [0..n] `role` pointing to a SequenceOntology term (optional)
  * [1..n] `location` identifying one or more regions on the parent sequence (required)

Moreover, a *validation rule* is needed: SequenceAnnotation can only be used if an actual sequence record is spefified for the parent ComponentDefinition.


3. Example or Use Case <a name='example'></a>
-------------------------------

Example use cases for the modified SequenceAnnotation are feature annotations such as START or STOP codons, mutations, highlighting regions referred to in a paper, sequence conflicts, etc, all mainly intended for human consumption. Over the evolution of a design, sequence features may later be formalized into re-usable subparts (i.e. 'Component's) It is therefore conceivable that a sequence editor reads in a genbank file with many sequence features and offers the user the easy conversion of some of those features into sub-parts.


4. Backwards Compatibility <a name='compatibility'></a>
-----------------

### 4.1 suggested transition path

Phase 1: SBOL 2.x
  * add `name` and `description` fields to SequenceAnnotation (both optional)
  * add `location` field to `Component`
  * mark `component` and `roleIntegration` as "deprecated" in `SequenceAnnotation`
  * advise software to stop using chains of SequenceAnnotation and Component in their SBOL output

Phase 2: SBOL 3.0
  * terminally deprecate SequenceAnnotation.component, SequenceAnnotation.roleIntegration

The disadvantage of a two-phase scheme is a relatively complex transition state where both old and new notations need to be supported. 


### 4.2 Conversion of SBOL 2.x records to 3.x:

  (1) remove intermediate `SequenceAnnotation` and move SequenceAnnotation.location to `Component`
  (2) optionally, try to flatten SequenceAnnotation - Component - ComponentDefinition chains of trivial annotations into SequenceAnnotation records

### 4.3 Backwards conversion of SBOL 3.x to 2.x records:

  * conversion of localized `Component`:
     (1) create `SequenceAnnotation` record pointing to subpart `Component`
     (2) move `location` from `Component` to `SequenceAnnotation`

  * conversion of non-localized `Component`:
     (0) no change required

  * conversion of SequenceAnnotation
     (1) create a ComponentDefinition with displayID=SequenceAnnotation.name and description=SequenceAnnotation.description
     (2) copy `type` field from the parent ComponentDefinition of the SequenceAnnotation to the new sub-part ComponentDefinition
     (3) move any `role` fields from the SequenceAnnotation to the new sub-part ComponentDefinition
     (4) create a `Component` record pointing to the new sub-part `ComponentDefinition`
     (5) create a `component` reference from parent ComponentDefinition to sub-part `Component`
     (6) create a `component` reference from SequenceAnnotation to sub-part `Component`


5. Discussion <a name='discussion'></a>
-----------------

### 5.1 author comments

The backward conversion (point 4.3 above) from the proposed back to the current
data model demonstrates that this proposal leads to important
simplifications. In the case of classic sequence feature annotations, a single
SequenceAnnotation object replaces three interlinked objects
with several mutually redundant fields.

As an added benefit, the proposed change would create a clear symmetry between
the sequence and the functional layer of SBOL: `Component` is now the exact
equivalent of `Participation`. The former describes a physical part- subpart
relation whereas the latter describes a functional part - subpart relation. Both
specify one or more `role` properties, both point to a
(sub)ComponentDefinition. Currently, this actual parallel is obfuscated by the
multiple references between parent and sub-part ComponentDefinition.

Optionally, one could discuss renaming `SequenceAnnotation` to `SequenceFeature`
and `Component` to `Subpart` in SBOL 3.0. This would make their respective purpose
and also the changes in the data model more explicit.


6. Competing SEPs <a name='competing_seps'></a>
-----------------

None. In the spirit of minimal change sets, this proposal could also be split up into three related SEPs (SequenceFeature, Merge SequenceAnnotation and Component, Rename SequenceAnnotation to Suppart).
