Abstract
-----------

A new, optional, `Component.sourceLocation` field is
proposed. `Component.sourceLocation` allows only a portion, rather than the
entirety, of a ComponentDefinition's sequence to be included in the Component's
parent. This serves two related purposes: (1) To support the insertion of parts
within a larger plasmid or genome "backbone". Typically, this will replace a
small segment of the backbone which, currently, cannot be expressed in SBOL. (2)
To support the "trimming" of part boundaries as it may happen during DNA
assembly.

1. Rationale <a name="rationale"></a>
----------------

The SBOL sequence data model so far assumes that parts are joined together such
that A + B + C gives exactly ABC. However, there are several very common
scenarios where the final sequence of a genetic design is **not** exactly the
sum of its parts:

(1) A designed sequence (e.g. synthetic gene or operon with many genes) is
inserted into a common plasmid backbone or into a genome. Typically, a small but
variable segment of the target vector is replaced in the process. This insert +
backbone scheme probably accounts for 90% of all genetic designs published until
today. Depending on assembly method, the insertion site and the extent of
replacement often is variable and cannot be predicted by the designer or
publisher of the backbone part.

(2) A larger sequence is assembled from re-usable fragments (e.g. promoter, RBS,
CDS, terminator) but the original fragments are "trimmed" in the process. This
may be a design decision (e.g. "Let's shorten this linker sequence") or a mere
technical consequence of DNA assembly. For example, neighboring parts may have
been registered with a complementary homology region, one copy of which
disappears during assembly.

### 1.1 current situation

SBOL can already cleanly represent complete insertions (without replacement),
such as ABC + X --> ABXC, by using the ability to put multiple ` Locations` on a
SequenceAnnotation. Multiple `Location` records are interpreted as the part
being split up in the parent (product) sequence. This is equivalent to the
"JOIN" statement in genbank.

At least in theory, complete insertions of a part can be handled with a `mapsTo`
statement such that ABC -> AXC. However, this requires that the exact
replacement site is aready annotated as a part when the backbone part is first
published. This is, in practice, rarely the case, with the notable exception of
certain highly structured Golden Gate cloning approaches such as MoClo.

Deletions such as ABC -> AC are not handled by current SBOL. Likewise, part
boundaries cannot be changed.

### 1.2 idea

The basic idea of this proposal is that a Component should be able to include
only a portion of its source sequence rather than necessarily the entirety of
it.  To do this, we add a new optional field, Component.sourceLocations which
can be used to specify which portions of the source's sequence are being used.

On the vector or "backbone" side, this allows us to "loose" some basepairs
around the insertion site. On the "insert" side, this allows us to trim the
source part before inserting or adding it to the final product.


2. Specification <a name="specification"></a>
----------------------------------------------

On Component, add an optional field "sourceLocations" with cardinality 0..*, which contains a set of Locations.

If Component.sourceLocations is not set, then the whole sequence is assumed to be included.

If Component.sourceLocations is set, then the relationship between the original
sequence and the sequence included is defined precisely complementary to
SequenceAnnotation.locations.

The sequence range or sequence ranges defined by Component.sourceLocation MUST add up to exactly the same length as the range(s) covered by the Component.location record(s). 

Rule sbol-10520 will need to be relaxed to account for partial sequence inclusion.
Additional new rules will need to be added, symmetric with those for SequenceAnnotation.locations


3. Example or Use Case <a name='example'></a>
-------------------------------

### 3.1 insertion into a plasmid

Let's assume we want to describe a plasmid "myPlasmid" which has been created by
inserting a single part "cargo" into a common plasmid backbone called
"backbone". The insert is 50 bp long and will replace 10 base pairs of the
vector backbone.

```
CD backbone
    sequence = Sequence of length 200

CD cargo
    sequence = Sequence of length 50

CD myPlasmid
    sequence = final Sequence of length 240 

    Component insert
        definition -> cargo
        location = Location 101..150

    Component backbone
        location = Location 1..100, 151..240
        sourceLocation = Location 1..100, 111..200
```

Note that Component "backbone" can be immediately validated by checking that
each of the sourceLocations has a (target) location of exactly matching length.
The final sequence of "myPlasmid" can also be constructed from the two
components and there is, stricly speaking, no need to list it again.

### 3.2 Merging two parts into a vector with Gibson assembly

Let's assume two genes, partA and partB, are inserted into a plasmid
"vector". Both vector and partA and partB are already designed such that partA
and partB are ready to be assembled into the vector. E.g. they may use
standardized homology flanks. During Gibson assembly, these homology regions are
merged. For the sake of clarity, homology arms are shortened to 5 bp (rather
than the more typical 25).

```
CD partA
    sequence = AAAAAGATACAGATACCCCC

CD partB
    sequence = CCCCCAAAAAAAAAATTTTT

CD vector*
    sequence = AAAAA|TTTTT...rest of vector
    type = SO term for "circular DNA"

CD myPlasmid
    sequence = AAAAAGATACAGATACCCCCAAAAAAAAAAATTTT...rest of vector

    Component A
        location 6..20
        sourceLocation 6..20

    Component B
        location 21..30
        sourceLocation 6..15

    Component backbone
        location 1..5, 31..end
```
* plasmid insertion site indicated by "|"
CD ... ComponentDefinition


4. Backwards Compatibility <a name='compatibility'></a>
-----------------

This SEP is backward compatible, in the sense that all prior SBOL 2.x files remain valid and 
retain their exact same meaning.

An old tool reading a file that uses Component.sourceLocation, however, will not know how
to correctly interpret the relationship between the two sequences affected by Component.sourceLocation,
however, and should report violation of rule sbol-10520.

This seems unlikely to be a major issue for two reasons:

1. sbol-10520 is a "best practices" rule, not a requirement
2. Any well-designed tool should react by refusing to make inferences about a sequence relationship 
  that it does not understand, thus at least not damaging files.


5. Discussion <a name='discussion'></a>
-----------------

### 5.1 Component vs. ComponentInstance <a name='componentinstance'></a>

Although we need sourceLocation to be available at Component, it is worth considering whether it should
be placed on its parent, ComponentInstance, in order to make sourceLocation available to 
FunctionalComponent as well.

A ModuleDefinition, however, has no Sequence for a "partial import" to be targeting. 
Since it is a different *type* of representation, every ComponentDefinition that is imported 
must be imported entirely.  The "partial import" analog would not be on FunctionalComponent
but some form of "partial import" field on Module.  We are not currently aware of any compelling
case for such, however (ModuleDefinitions do not have the equivalent of the massive sequence
information associated ComponentDefinitions), we do not propose any such modification at this time, 
but note that it would be reasonable to consider in the future if sufficient motivation appears.

### 5.2 Alternative proposal: Microcomponent mappings <a name='alternative'></a>

A competing proposal has been put forth (though not yet formalized into an SEP), for representing
sequence modifications through MapsTo.  The basic idea of this proposal is to make use of the 
"useLocal" option on MapsTo to specify a modification of the sequence. A basic example would look like this:

```
CD InsertionSite1
   ...
CD InsertionSite2
   ...
CD InsertionSite3
   ...

CD backbone
        Component InsertionSite1
                Location 11..20
        Component InsertionSite2
                Location 12..19
        Component InsertionSite3
                Location 10..21
        Sequence of length 200 bases

CD cargo
        Sequence of length 20 bases

CD MyInsertion
        Component MyCargo
                Location 11..30
                Definition cargo
        Component MyBackBone
                Location 1..9, 31..210
                Definition backbone
                MapsTo
                        Local MyCargo
                        Remote InsertionSite1
```

For deletion, we can either use a sequence of length 0 or we can allow a MapsTo
to have no local, implying deletion (change to the current data model). This
approach is advantageous in that it can be technically implemented without
any modification of the data model (using empty sequences).  Conceptually,
however, the MapsTo approach represents a major kludge, in that it requires the
introduction of a potentially large number of ComponentDefinitions without any
particular engineering meaning, that only exist to represent statements about
potential insertion sites.

Our community has already strongly rejected this idea in SEP004, which allows us
to represent small statements about sequence features, like targets and cut
sites, without having to separate those fragments (which do not have an
independent existence) as ComponentDefinition.  We thus have a clear precedent
for "ComponentDefinition" representing a unit of engineering modularity, rather
than a unit of sequence information.  Moreover, under the MapsTo approach,
describing a new ComponentDefinition forces one to modify an existing
ComponentDefinition, which seems to be a clear violation of modularity.  There
are also technical issues, such as interaction with sbol-10520 and sbol-10526,
but the major challenge is the conceptual change implied by the use of MapsTo in
this fashion.
