Abstract
-----------

SBOL needs a good way to represent the relationship between two sequences, when one has been derived
from the other through a process of small insertions, deletions, and modifications (e.g., via 
gene editing or mutation).  This SEP proposes to support such representations through addition of
a new field, Component.sourceLocations, which allows only a portion, rather than the entirety, of a
ComponentDefinition's sequence to be included in the Component's parent.  We also compare and 
contrast with an alternate proposal for carrying out the same operation by embedding new 
"microcomponents" into the original component definition in order to represent the sequence 
alterations and then using them to override portions of the orignal sequence.

1. Rationale <a name="rationale"></a>
----------------

We need a good way to represent modifications of a sequence, such as insertion, mutation, and deletion.  
SBOL has been designed to compose elements A and B to create a new element AB.  
We are now considering a closely related but slightly different case of taking element ABC and 
creating from it sequences AC, AXC, or ABXC.

* SBOL can already readily and cleanly represent ABC + X --> ABXC by using the ability to put multiple Locations on a SequenceAnnotation.
* ABC -> AXC and ABC -> AC are not cleanly handled by current SBOL, but can be handled if we allow Location to be symmetrically specified for the source ComponentDefinition.

The basic idea of this proposal is that a Component should be able to include only a portion 
of its source rather than necessarily the entirety of it.  
To do this, we add a new optional field, Component.sourceLocations which can be used to 
specify which portions of the source's sequence are being used.

Note that this is neatly symmetric to the existing usage of Location, by which a 
Sequence imported through a Component can be placed into any fragment of the Sequence of the 
ComponentDefinition to which it has been imported. 

2. Specification <a name="specification"></a>
----------------------------------------------

On Component, add an optional field "sourceLocations" with cardinality 0..*, which contains a set of Locations.

If Component.sourceLocations is not set, then the whole sequence is assumed to be included.

If Component.sourceLocations is set, then the relationship between the original sequence and the
sequence included is defined precisely complementary to SequenceAnnotation.locations

Rule sbol-10520 will need to be relaxed to account for partial sequence inclusion.
Additional new rules will need to be added, symmetric with those for SequenceAnnotation.locations


3. Example or Use Case <a name='example'></a>
-------------------------------

Let us consider a 1-base modification of the GFP coding sequence BBa\_E0040 (http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_E0040:Design).
This sequence is 720 base-pairs long, and let us consider the following modifications at base 503:

* Mutation: 'atgcgt ... gaaaca ... taataa' --> 'atgcgt ... gataca ... taataa'
* Deletion: 'atgcgt ... gaaaca ... taataa' --> 'atgcgt ... gaaca ... taataa'

In order to represent modification, we set Component.sourceLocation to the portion that is identical, 
leaving out the part that is modified. In the BBa\_E0040 example, the new ComponentDefinition 
"BBa\_E0040new" includes BBa\_E0040 as a component, but sets its Component.sourceLocation to 
Range(1,502);Range(504,720).  The SequenceAnnotation on BBa\_E0040new then uses those same locations.

For deletion, we simply set Component.sourceLocation to the portion that is retained.
The BBa_E0040 example then plays out exactly the same, except that the SequenceAnnotation can 
just use Range(1,719) since there's no "t" base in the middle to skip over.


4. Backwards Compatibility <a name='compatibility'></a>
-----------------

This SEP is backward compatible, in the sense that all prior SBOL 2.x files remain valid and 
retain their exact same meaning.

An old tool reading a file that uses Component.sourceLocation, however, will not know how
to correctly interpret the relationship between the two sequences affected by Component.sourceLocation,
however, and should report violation of rule sbol-10520.

This seems unlikely to be a major issue for two reasons:

1. sbol-10520 is a "best practices" rule, not a requirement
2. Any well-designed tool should react by refusing to make inferences about a sequence relationship 
  that it does not understand, thus at least not damaging files.

5. Discussion <a name='discussion'></a>
-----------------

### 5.1 Component vs. ComponentInstance <a name='componentinstance'></a>

Although we need sourceLocation to be available at Component, it is worth considering whether it should
be placed on its parent, ComponentInstance, in order to make sourceLocation available to 
FunctionalComponent as well.

A ModuleDefinition, however, has no Sequence for a "partial import" to be targeting. 
Since it is a different *type* of representation, every ComponentDefinition that is imported 
must be imported entirely.  The "partial import" analog would not be on FunctionalComponent
but some form of "partial import" field on Module.  We are not currently aware of any compelling
case for such, however (ModuleDefinitions do not have the equivalent of the massive sequence
information associated ComponentDefinitions), we do not propose any such modification at this time, 
but note that it would be reasonable to consider in the future if sufficient motivation appears.

### 5.2 Alternative proposal: Microcomponent mappings <a name='alternative'></a>
A competing proposal has been put forth (though not yet formalized into an SEP), for representing
sequence modifications through MapsTo.  The basic idea of this proposal is to make use of the 
"useLocal" option on MapsTo to specify a modification of the sequence.

In order to represent modification, we would make two new ComponentDefinitions, representing 
the modifications, and a MapsTo that uses useLocal to override the fragment being changed.
In the BBa\_E0040 example, we create a new ComponentDefinition, "BBa\_E0040modsite" whose sequence is "a"
Then we modify BBa\_E0040 to include "BBa\_E0040modsite" as a component.
The modified ComponentDefinition, "BBa\_E0040new" includes as components both BBa\_E0040 and 
another new ComponentDefinition, "BBa\_E0040mod" with sequence "t".  
We then create a MapsTo in BBa\_E0040new, linking BBa\_E0040modsite to BBa\_E0040mod with relationship useLocal.

For deletion, we can either use a sequence of length 0 or we can allow a MapsTo to have no local, 
implying deletion. The BBa\_E0040 example then plays out the same for deletion except that either 
BBa\_E0040mod has sequence "" or else it doesn't exist and the MapsTo has an empty local.

This approach is advantageous in that it can be technically be implemented without 
any modification of the data model (using empty sequences).
Conceptually, however, the MapsTo approach represents a major kludge, in that it requires the
introduction of a potentially large number of ComponentDefinitions without any particular
engineering meaning, that only exist to represent statements about a location.
Our community has already strongly rejected this idea in SEP004, which allows us to represent small statements
about sequence features, like targets and cut sites, without having to separate those
fragments (which do not have an independent existence) as ComponentDefinition.
We thus have a clear precedent for "ComponentDefinition" representing
a unit of engineering modularity, rather than a unit of sequence information.
Moreover, under the MapsTo approach, describing a new ComponentDefinition forces one to modify
an existing ComponentDefinition, which seems to be a clear violation of modularity.
There are also technical issues, such as interaction with sbol-10520 and sbol-10526, but
the major challenge is the conceptual change implied by the use of MapsTo in this fashion.
