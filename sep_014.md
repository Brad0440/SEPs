Motivation <a name="motivation"></a>
-------------

Linking data through different stages of the synthetic biology workflow is starting to be a troublesome bottleneck for many synthetic biologists. [Recently, a member of our community commented that linking experimental data with designs is becoming "critical" to a number of important projects](https://groups.google.com/forum/?hl=us#!topic/sbol-dev/DxXJFVrqGyQ). In our own lab, linking design data with data about actual instances (or "clones") of plasmid constructs has also been an issue for us. This was the topic of a talk I gave at IWBDA 2015 about quality control for synthetic biology. Very likely, others in synthetic biology are also encountering this difficulty, and there now seems to be momentum in the SBOL development community for addressing these issues. 

To motivate further discussion on this issue, this SEP introduces a design-build-test data model for SBOL. 

The field of synthetic biology borrows from more conventional engineering fields a framework for problem-solving known as the design-build-test cycle. The design-build-test cycle is essentially the scientific method applied in the context of engineering. Stages in the cycle include designing an inital prototype, testing that prototype, analyzing its performance against specific metrics, learning what worked and what did not work, designing a new prototype based on what was learned, and completing the cycle again. Ideally each cycle generates new understanding that feeds back into new cycles as alternative approaches or reformulated problems. 

The design-build-test cycle is especially important in the context of synthetic biology because trial and failure is an essential part of the process. Due to the unpredictability of biological systems, many prototypes (biological variants) of a genetic construct are often tested before arriving at the desired system behavior. Thus, synthetic biologists must routinely manage many cycles of designing, building, and testing genetic systems. The biodesign automation community was thus born out of a need to connect collaborators at different stages of synthetic biology with automated workflows. The synthetic biology cycle includes stages like mining DNA parts from online databases, assembling new genetic programs from DNA sequences, synthesizing and assembling DNA, quality control, quantitative characterization of a DNA partâ€™s encoded behavior, and submitting characterized parts to inventories so that other engineers may reusethem. 

The origins of the design-build-test framework for engineering can be traced back to a business practice called product life-cycle management. In the 1980s the American Motor Corporation began developing a business practice called product life-cycle management (PLM) to help teams of engineers collaborate. Their automated PLM systems supported design-build-test workflows for engineers using off-the-shelf components, computer-aided design tools, and networked databases containing design specifications and documentation [1, 2]. The design-build-test cycle appears frequently in literature about PLM from the 1990s[1, 3]. Later, in the early 2000s, the design-build-test problem-solving framework became incorporated into educational pedagogy, especially in the context of engineering education[4, 5]. Nowadays, the design-build-test problem-solving framework has become a fundamental principle for synthetic biology [6, 7].  Two conceptualizations of this are shown below.

[As the SBOL Chair recently observed (on 6/17/17)](https://groups.google.com/forum/?hl=us#!topic/sbol-dev/DxXJFVrqGyQ), SBOL does not distinguish between designs that have been fabricated as DNA or subsequently tested. The design-build-test data model introduced in this SEP makes these stages explicit, and can be broadly understood inside and outside the SBOL community. As we expand the SBOL data model, it is important that we use simple and easy-to-understand concepts in order to promote broad interest and adoption. I hope that this proposal will stimulate and orient upcoming conversations about capturing the provenance of assemblies and experimental data. 

Specification <a name="specification"></a>
----------------
 
This SEP proposes three new TopLevel classes: `Design`, `Build`, and `Test`.

![Design, Build, Test](images/sep_014_fig2.png "Design, Build, Test")

The `Design` and `Build` classes are shown boxed around a `ComponentDefinition`, indicating that
they are derived from `ComponentDefinitions`. The distinction between them is that a `Build` refers to a real, physical sample of DNA in the lab that corresponds to the target `Design`. Hence a `Build` has a field for `sampleId`. As a practical matter, I have found that the `Design` should contain detailed structural data, such as component hierarchies, while the `Build` should typically be a flat representation. One reason for this is because there may be many `Build`s derived from a `Design`, and it would be inefficient and redundant to include the detailed structural data for every `Build`. Instead each `Build` should refer back to the `Design` from which it was derived, and hence has a `design` property. In addition, each `Build` should refer to a unique Sequence object that represents a consensus sequence obtained for that `Build` (obtained from DNA sequencing).  Using PROV-O classes it should be possible to include additional details about the assembly protocol used to build the constructs (see Example). 

The `Test` class is simply an `Identified` object with a link to an external data file or files. The SBOL community may wish to discuss further metadata which is important, but at the minimum we can likely agree that is is important to link the data files.  Hence the `Test` class has a `dataFiles` property. There may be multiples `Tests` linking back to a given `Build`. 

This data model would go a long way towards addressing the community's need for meta-data linking experimental data with the constructs and protocols used to produce the data.

Example <a name="example"></a>
--------
The following shows an SBOL data structure representing a plasmid construct with quality control annotations added and links to flow-cytometry data. Information about hierarchical structure should be contained in the `Design`, and need not be redundantly repeated for every build.

![Example1](images/sep_014_fig3.png "Example1")

A `Design` and `Build` may also be linked by PROV-O classes. This link however requires several degrees of indirection through `Activity` and `Usage` classes and is not very intuitive. An advantage of this proposal is that it makes explicity the relationship between Design and Build ComponentDefinitions. An experimental protocol can be captured by a Plan object and the person who performed the protocol may be represented by an Agent. However, the preferred ontology terms and other fine details about how to represent experiments with PROV-O is still open for discussion and outside the scope of this SEP.

Backwards Compatibility <a name="example"></a>
-------------------------
This SEP does not affect backwards compatibility.

Discussion <a name="discussion"></a>
----------
In the motivation section, I have included links to the original thread which motivated this SEP. I hope this proposal will be dicussed more at the SBOL workshop in Seattle, June 2017, and will update this section accordingly.
