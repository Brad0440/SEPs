Motivation <a name="motivation"></a>
----------
To specify a general container for a file attachment including metadata that helps tools interpret the file

Specification <a name="specification"></a>
-------------

The `Attachment` class is a `TopLevel` object. `Collections` MAY refer to `Attachments`.  

The Attachment class has four properties:
“format” which is the format for the protocol, an EDAM protocol
* `source` - The source is a link to the external file and is REQUIRED.
* `format` - The format is an ontology term indicating the format of the file. It is RECOMMENDED to use the EDAM ontology for file formats, which includes a variety of experimental data formats. The `format` is a REQUIRED field
* `size` - The size is a long integer indicating the file size. This may be used by client applications accessing files over RESTful APIs. This field is OPTIONAL.
* `hash` - The hash is a string used to retrieve files from a cache. This field is OPTIONAL.

Discussion <a name="discussion"></a>
----------
This proposal has been discussed extensively at HARMONY 2017 and on the Github issue tracker. There is general consensus that an `Attachment` is needed.  Some have proposed that any `TopLevel` object should be able to link an `Attachment`, but a concern raised with this approach is that it becomes difficult for developers to interpret when and where the `Attachment` should be added. Therefore this proposal specifies that only `Collections` may link to `Attachments`.  However, at a later date, there may be justifiable reasons to allow other core SBOL classes to link `Attachments`.

Relation to Other SEPs <a name="relation"></a>
----------------------
This proposal relates to SEP 14, 16, and 17, all of which deal with how experimental data should be linked to SBOL.

Backwards Compatibility <a name="compatability"></a>
-----------------------
This proposal does not affect backwards compatibility.
