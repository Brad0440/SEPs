Abstract
-----------

We suggest to split the current SequenceAnnotation class into two classes -- SequenceFeature and Subpart -- which more specifically and explicitely represent the two current main use cases of sequence annotations. Subpart is reserved for part composition relationships which will always point to an existing (and presumably re-usable) sub-component but for which sequence location or indeed sequence information may or may not be available. By contrast, SequenceFeature is used for classic sequence feature annotations as known from the genbank format and thus only apply to clearly specified sequence regions. This re-organization allows for the simplification of the sequence layer data model.


1. Rationale <a name="rationale"></a>
----------------

### 1.1 current situation

The current `SequenceAnnotation` class has a dual purpose:

(1) Its primary role is to specify the location of "sub-parts" within the sequence of a parent ComponentDefinition. To this end, `SequenceAnnotation` links one or more `Location` records with a `Component`. The `Component`, in turn, refers to a `ComponentDefinition` (via its `definition` field). This `ComponentDefinition` is the description of the actual sub-part. Actual physical composition is therefore defined like this:

`ComponentDefinition` -[`sequenceAnnotation`]-> `SequenceAnnotation` -[`component`]-> `ComponentDefinition` -[`definition`]-> `ComponentDefinition`

Unfortunately, none of the field or class names actually suggest a part / sub-part relationship. The directionality (which one is parent and which one is a sub-part) is also frequently confused. The above graph is still simplified: the parent `ComponentDefinition` also directly links to the sub-part `Component` via a `component` field. This is necessary so that composition can be described before any sequences (and thus sequence locations) are known. An additional chain of references is therefore needed, in parallel to the one shown above:

`ComponentDefintion` -[`component`]-> `Component` -[`definition`]-> `ComponentDefinition`

Adding to this evident redundancy, both `Component` and `SequenceAnnotation` may have `role` properties that diverge from the `role` (functional classification) of the target `ComponentDefinition`. Whether a diverging `role` is attached to `Component` or `SequenceAnnotation` is an arbitrary choice. This invites conflicting implementations and interpretations of this field. 

Evidently, SBOL makes the description of "undefined", "loose bag", part composition without any sequence information relatively easy. By contrast, the description of actual genetic design with actual sequences is surprisingly complex and full of redundancies. This is unfortunate because the latter is the, by and far, overwhelming use case of SBOL. It also hinders adoption by sequence-level designers and tool developers. 

(2) The secondary role of `SequenceAnnotation` is to simply annotate regions of interest within a given sequence. Arguably, this should be its primary role (hence the name) as it is the more common use case in practice. However, this function is currently only supported in theory, not in practice.

A `SequenceAnnotation` without `component` can be created and linked to a region of, e.g., DNA. However, the only other field available for describing this region is `role` which must point to a SO term. By contrast, Genbank annotations naturally have a 'name' and a 'description' attached to them. `SequenceAnnotation` is lacking these fields because it is (in the sub-part scenario) supposed to link to another ComponentDefinition. Therefore, even the most simple annotation of, let's say, a START codon, therefore requires us to create the full chain of `SequenceAnnotation` -> `Component` -> `ComponentDefinition`. This introduces the additional complication of creating lots of meaningless and potentially overlapping part definitions that are not meant to be actual (re-usable) parts.


### 1.2 proposal

The two purposes of SequenceAnnotation should be seperated and, in turn, simplified.

(1) Support / simplify classic sequence annotations of features which do not fall into the part - subpart category. As a welcome side effect, this should make it much easier to move back and forth between SBOL and large bodies of existing genbank-formatted information and related software. A new class `SequenceFeature` is proposed.

(2) Make the actual part - subpart purpose of the current SequenceAnnotation more explicit and direct. We propose to merge `Component` and `SequenceAnnotation` into a class renamed to `Subpart`.

(3) Create a syntactic parallel between sequence/physical and functional part-subpart relations in SBOL -- The Subpart class will be equivalent in syntax and meaning to the existing `Participation` class. For programmers, the pattern `ComponentDefinition -> Subpart(role) -> ComponentDefinition` will look and feel like the already established pattern `Interaction -> Participation(role) -> ComponentDefinition`. 

(4) Remove ambiguity as to how things can / should be expressed at the sequence layer to aid meaningful data exchange. 


2. Specification <a name="specification"></a>
----------------------------------------------

### 2.1 Merge `SequenceAnnotation` and `Component` into **`Subpart`**

SBOL 2.x SequenceAnnotation is renamed to Subpart in order to more clearly
distinguish its purpose from the the new SequenceFeature class. `Subpart`
assimilates `Component` (removing the most notorious source of data model
ambiguity at the sequence level). It is solely used for part-subpart relations.

`Subpart` is derrived from `ComponentInstance`. All its *required* fields are inherited from `ComponentInstance`:

  * [1] `definition` pointing to the sub-part `ComponentDefinition`
  * [1] `access` pointing to one of two URIs ("public", "private")

`Subpart` has the following *optional* fields:

  * [0..n] `location` pointing to a `Location` on the *parent* `ComponentDefinition` sequence; if missing, this indicates a part / sub-part relationship for which sequence details have not (yet) been determined.
  * [0..n] `mapsTo` pointing to another `ComponentInstance`
  * [0..n] `role` pointing to SO terms
  * [0..n] `roleIntegration` pointing to one of two SBOL terms ('overrideRoles' or 'mergeRoles')

The `ComponentDefinition.sequenceAnnotation` and `ComponentDefinition.component` field should be renamed / replaced by a field `subpart` pointing to a `Subpart` instance.


### 2.2 New class **SequenceFeature**

`SequenceFeature` has the following *required fields*:

  * [1] `location` pointing to a `Location` record
  * [1] `name` pointing to a literal value
  
The following fields are *optional*:

  * [0..1] `description` pointing to a human-readable comment
  * [0..n] `role` pointing to a SequenceOntology term 

Moreover, a *validation rule* is needed: SequenceFeatures can only be used if an actual sequence record is spefified for the parent ComponentDefinition.


3. Example or Use Case <a name='example'></a>
-------------------------------

Example use cases for SequenceFeature are feature annotations such as START or STOP codons, mutations, highlighting regions referred to in a paper, sequence conflicts, etc, all mainly intended for human consumption. Over the evolution of a design, sequence features may later be upgraded to re-usable subparts. It is therefore conceivable that a sequence editor reads in a genbank file with many sequence features and offers the user the easy conversion of some of those features into sub-parts. 


4. Backwards Compatibility <a name='compatibility'></a>
-----------------

A transition path towards the new data model could consist of two phases:

Phase 1: SBOL 2.x
  * introduce SequenceFeature and Subpart classes
  * retain SequenceAnnotation labelled as "deprecated, to be removed in SBOL 3.0"
  * advise software to internally convert SequenceAnnotation to Subpart

Phase 2: SBOL 3.0
  * terminally deprecate SequenceAnnotation and ComponentDefinition.annotation


Conversion of SBOL 2.x records to 3.x:

  (1) rename SequenceAnnotation to Subpart
  (2) remove intermediate `Component` and move Component.definition, .access and .role fields to 
    Subpart
  (3) rename ComponentDefinition.sequenceAnnotation field to subpart

Conversion of SBOL 3.x to 2.x records:

  * conversion of Suppart:
     (1) rename Subpart -> SequenceAnnotation
     (2) rename ComponentDefinition.subpart -> sequenceAnnotation
     (3) create `Component` record pointing to subpart `ComponentDefinition`

  * conversion of SequenceFeature:
     (1) create a ComponentDefinition with displayID=SequenceFeature.name (if possible) and description=SequenceFeaure.description, generate internal URI
     (2) copy `type` field from the parent ComponentDefinition of the SequenceFeature 
     (3) create a `Component` record pointing to the new `ComponentDefinition`
     (4) create a `SequenceAnnotation` record pointing to the new `Component`
     (5) move any SequenceFeature.role field to the `SequenceAnnotation`


5. Discussion <a name='discussion'></a>
-----------------

(5.1) Why merging `Component` and `Subpart` (`SequenceAnnotation`)?

Subpart is the sequence-layer equivalent of the `Participation` class. It allows
to express a sub-part relationship along with a contextual `role` of this
sup-part, which may differ from the part's generic `role`. Just as Participation
points directly to ComponentDefinition, also Subpart should point directly to
ComponentDefinition. Just as `Participation`, `Subpart` *is* an
instantiation of a ComponentDefinition so there is no need for an additional
wrapping. This removes redundancies from the data model. For example, it removes
the current ambiguity as to what kind of information (e.g. diverging roles)
should be attached to Component versus SequenceAnnotion. It also streamlines
XML/RDF records (a lot).

(5.2) Why not only adding `SequenceFeature` to the existing data model?

Advantages of such a minimal data model change are clear:
  * no issues of backwards compatibility
  * possibility of implementing this as a 2.x change
  * existing library code base only needs to be extended with minor changes

Adding SequenceFeature without further changes would, in fact, add to the existing complexity. Semantically, third-party devs will find it difficult to understand the difference between SequenceAnnotation and SequenceFeature. Currently, there is regular confusion even among core SBOL developers about the meaning and proper use of SequenceAnnotation. Example questions are:

  * Which ComponentDefinition is parent and which one is "child" 
    (a.ka. subpart) in this relationship?
  * What's the meaning of a "SequenceAnnotation" without any underlying sequence?
  * Where should I attach roles -- to Component, SequenceAnnotation, or ComponentDefinition?
  * Can two SequenceAnnotations point to the same Component? In other words, should there be one Component for each SequenceAnnotation or for each sub-part ComponentDefinition? (Both is possible and there is no meaningful difference but this ambiguity makes data exchange between different tools more challenging.)

The proposed renaming and simplification would create a clear symmetry between
the sequence and the functional layer of SBOL: `Subpart` is the exact equivalent
of `Participation`. The former describes a physical part- subpart relation
whereas the latter describes a functional part - subpart relation. Both specify
one or more `role` properties, both point to a (sub)ComponentDefinition.


6. Competing SEPs <a name='competing_seps'></a>
-----------------

None. In the spirit of minimal change sets, this proposal could also be split up into three related SEPs (SequenceFeature, Merge SequenceAnnotation and Component, Rename SequenceAnnotation to Suppart).
